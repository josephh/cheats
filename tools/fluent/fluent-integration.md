## Workflows - versioning
Within the Fluent Platform, all workflows are versioned. Any modification of an existing workflow by a Retailer results in the automatic creation of a new version of the workflow.
 * A major version represents a major change in the flow such as an addition of a new state transition and new business logic.
 * A minor change involves changing parameters such as changing the email template for customer notifications or updating the expiry time of articles.

## Events
There are 3 different ways to view audit events:
1. Event API (using Postman)
1. Event Search (Insights in Fluent OMS)
1. Activity tab (for each order)

## Support
Fluent Commerce provides Level 1 platform support.
## Platform Related Issues
If a partner has conducted their investigations and has discovered a platform-related issue, then they must create a support ticket using the JIRA service desk, along with the details about the account, retailer, workflow, exceptions, event logs, etc.
## Expert Services
Another method in which Fluent Commerce can offer expert advice is via the Expert Services team.
