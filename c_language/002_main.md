`main` is where the program starts (and 'main' is a keyword). **C is case-sensitive!  Indentation is largely irrelevant but syntax is crucial**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { // block scoped function body, could also read `int main(void) {...}
  printf("Hello world!");
  return 0; // error code
}
```
