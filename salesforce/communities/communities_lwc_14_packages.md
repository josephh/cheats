# SALESFORCE _ COMMUNITIES - 14 PACKAGES
* There are 2 types of packages: 'managed' and 'unlocked'.
(Note there are also 2 Salesforce packaging technologies, 1st and 2nd Gen).

'Unlocked' packages also result in the installation of components into another org; however, they can readily be amended or deleted by that org's administrator.
