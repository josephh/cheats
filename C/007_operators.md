# C Programming
## Operators
### Arithmetic
++ -- increment decrement (pre or post)
### Logical
&& || AND, OR.  If numeric operands are non zero they are considered to be true
! logical not inverts the logic
### Bitwise
&
|
^
~ // binary one's complement - flips bits (unary (only has one operand))
<< // bitwise left shift - moves bits by the specified number of place (unary (only has one operand))
>> // bitwise right shift - moves bits by the specified number of place (unary (only has one operand))
### Assignment
= += -= *= /= %= left operand is assigned the result of the operation on it plus the RHS
<<= left shift AND
>>= right shift AND
&= bitwise AND
^= bitwise exclusive OR assignment
|= bitwise inclusive OR assignment
### Relational
== <= < > >=
